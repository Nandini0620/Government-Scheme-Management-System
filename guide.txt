### Setting Up the Government Scheme Management System in VS Code

Here's how to set up and run the project using Visual Studio Code:

## 1. Create a New Next.js Project

Open your terminal and run:

```shellscript
npx create-next-app gov-scheme-system
cd gov-scheme-system
```

## 2. Open the Project in VS Code

```shellscript
code .
```

This will open the project in VS Code. Alternatively, you can open VS Code first, then use File > Open Folder to navigate to your project directory.

## 3. Install Required Dependencies

Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal) and run:

```shellscript
npm install lucide-react
npx shadcn@latest init
```

When prompted during shadcn/ui setup, select:

- TypeScript: Yes
- Style: Default (or your preference)
- Base color: Default (or your preference)
- Global CSS: Yes
- CSS variables: Yes
- React Server Components: Yes
- Components location: @/components
- Utilities location: @/lib/utils
- Include example components: No


## 4. Install shadcn/ui Components

```shellscript
npx shadcn@latest add button card input label checkbox badge progress tabs table radio-group select separator
```

## 5. Create Project Files

In VS Code's Explorer panel (left sidebar), create the following folder structure:

```plaintext
app/
├── dashboard/
│   ├── citizen/
│   └── official/
├── login/
├── register/
└── schemes/
    └── [id]/
```

## 6. Copy the Code Files

For each file in the code block I provided earlier:

1. Create a new file at the specified path in VS Code
2. Copy the code content into the file
3. Save the file (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)


For example:

- Create `app/page.tsx` and paste the home page code
- Create `app/register/page.tsx` and paste the registration page code
- And so on for all the files


## 7. Run the Development Server

In the VS Code terminal, run:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## 8. View the Application

The terminal will show a URL (typically [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)). You can:

- Ctrl+click (or Cmd+click) the URL in the terminal to open it in your browser
- Or manually open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## VS Code Tips for This Project

1. **Install Extensions** for a better development experience:

1. ESLint
2. Prettier
3. Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
4. ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets



2. **Use the integrated terminal** to run commands without leaving VS Code
3. **Split editors** to view multiple files side by side (drag a tab to the side of the editor)
4. **Use the Problems panel** (View > Problems) to see any errors or warnings
5. **Use the built-in Git integration** to track changes (Source Control icon in the sidebar)


The project should now be running and ready for you to explore and modify in VS Code!
